This is a For Desktop Progressive Web Application (PWA) written in TypeScript and built with Vite, a build tool for modern web development. The application also utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and Local Storage for data persistence.

Getting Started
---------------

To run the application locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Install the dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
4.  Start the application by running the command `npm run dev`.

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:<some-port-#>`. Check your terminal for the exact port number.

This application is a PWA, which means it can be installed and used offline on any desktop or laptop machine. To do this, simply visit the website https://qtaskmanager.onrender.com/ on your machine and click the install button located at the right side of the url bar.

Features
--------

This application is a simple Trello clone that allows you to add, delete and edit tasks. The state of the tasks is persisted using Local Storage, so your tasks will be saved even if you close the browser window or application if saved to your machine.

The application is built with TypeScript, which allows for easier development and maintainability of the codebase. Additionally, it uses Vite for fast and efficient builds, which makes development a breeze.

The styling of the application is done using Tailwind CSS, which provides a highly customizable set of CSS utilities that can be used to quickly and easily style components.

Build and Deployment
--------------------

To build the application for production, run the command `npm run build`. This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized and minified files ready for deployment.
